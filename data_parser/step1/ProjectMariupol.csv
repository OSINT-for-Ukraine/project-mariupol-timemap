Russian occupation forces are organizing a two-stage referendum in the temporarily occupied Berdyansk on joining Russia. It is scheduled for September 11th. At the first stage of the so called referendum, ""voting"" at polling stations is planned. Furthermore, due to the possibility of lack of support of the local population,  a second stage for the referendum is envisaged which is bribery of locals apartment-by-apartment. 

""To do this, all heads of condominiums were forced to collect apartment-by-apartment lists of those willing to receive 10,000 rubles or humanitarian aid.  They will be included in the lists of those who voted - automatically. Thus, the second stage will provide an opportunity to falsify the vote, including at the expense of citizens who have left.  In addition, employees of captured public utilities and public sector institutions will automatically ""vote"", because their data was collected by the Russians in advance.

A Russian drone appears to have targeted a TV crew from Swedish channel TV4 (Johan Fredriksson, Daniel Zdolsek, and Oleksandr Pavlov). The strike destroyed their car, which was marked with a ""Press"" sign. The journalists and their police escort were returning to their vehicles after filming and managed to flee the drone, but Ukrainian producer Pavlov and the two police officers were slightly injured.

Geolocated from photographs taken at the scene and Oleksandr Pavlov's description in his interview with the National Union of Journalists of Ukraine.
